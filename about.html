<h1>About Me</h1>
<ul><p><h2 style="text-align: center">🌟 About Dennis Ohimaime Raymond (aka Deevinitee)</h2>></p></ul>

    I am Dennis Ohimaime Raymond, known to many as Deevinitee — a passionate, purpose-driven creative and visionary. My journey spans across Web Design & Development, Graphic Design, Education, Photography, Movie Directing, Tutoring, and Entrepreneurship. But more than what I do, I represent what’s possible when creativity, compassion, and calling collide.

From the very beginning, my life has been shaped by two things: grace and grit. I’m a B.Sc. holder in Computer Science from the Federal University of Petroleum Resources, Effurun (FUPRE), Delta State, Nigeria, and my university journey was filled with challenges. But with God’s help and unwavering determination, I didn’t just graduate — I found purpose. I saw firsthand the struggles of students and young adults, and I knew I had to become the solution they needed.

My late mother was my first coach — a beacon of belief and wisdom. Her memory continues to fuel my desire to help others. My mission is to guide young lives toward discovering the right path, to help them understand the purpose of their creation, and to mold them into relevant, purposeful minds within society.

This vision became reality on July 10, 2023, when I founded Deevinitee Academ & Resorts — a one-of-a-kind establishment blending academia with experience, knowledge with luxury, and inspiration with innovation. From offering skill-based and academic programs to creating restful, elegant resort spaces, our brand uplifts, educates, and transforms.

<ul><p><h2 style="text-align: center">🎓 Background & Journey</h2></p></ul>
I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the Federal University of Petroleum Resources, Effurun (FUPRE), Delta State, Nigeria. My academic journey was marked with challenges — moments of struggle that opened my eyes to the pain and hurdles many students face. Through these experiences, I discovered my purpose: to help fix the lives of students, young adults, and teenagers — and empower them with better opportunities, mentorship, and purpose.

My late mother — my mentor and first coach — remains the eternal spark behind my passion. Her guidance shaped my mind and heart, and her legacy inspires me to help others discover their full potential.
